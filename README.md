### Title: 

Hydrodynamical results on femtoscopy in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV

### Abstract: 

The hydrodynamical model has a long history in high-energy physics, being an essential tool for describing
the collective behaviour of the matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Recently,
experimental results have shown evidence of a similar collective behavior in small systems.
Femtoscopy or HBT Effect, are a powerful probe of the space-time geometry of the particle emitting source.
In this work, a study of such correlations is perform using the event-by-event hydrodynamical model in 2+1
dimensions (boost invariance) by vHLLE code \[1]. Both the ideal and the viscous (shear and bulk) fluid cases
are considered. The initial conditions was genereted by TRENTo model \[2]. An equation of state inspired in
lattice QCD results \[3], with a crossover phase transition between the quark-gluon plasma and the hadronic
phase, is employed. And the decoupling was calculated by THERMINATOR2 \[4]. The results are compared
with experimental data on pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV \[5].

### Title: 

Effects of dissipative hydrodynamics on elliptic flow and HBT interferometry in central collisions

### Abstract: 

In this work, we study relativistic heavy ion collisions by using a hydrodynamical model in 2+1 dimensions
(boost invariance) for ideal and viscous fluids calculated by vHLLE code \[1]. We use smooth initial conditions
genereted by TRENTo model \[2] and an equation of state inspired in lattice QCD results (3+1 flavours) \[3] with
a crossover phase transition between the quark-gluon plasma and the hadronic phase. The decoupling criteria
was performed by THERMINATOR2 code \[4].
The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of dissipative effects on the elliptic flow and HBT radii.
The calculations are performed for central Au+Au collisions (0-5%) with √sNN = 200 GeV and compared with
experimental data from STAR \[5] and PHOBOS \[6] collaborations at RHIC. The results show the inclusion of
dissipative effects is important for describing the experimental data.
