# Title: 

Results on femtoscopy from hydrodinamics in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV

# Abstract: 

The hydrodynamical model has a long history in high-energy physics,
being an essential tool for describing the collective behaviour of
the matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and
LHC. Recently, experimental results have shown evidence of a similar
collective behavior in small systems (pp and pPb collisions).

Bose-Einstein correlation or femtoscopy, are a powerful probe of the
space-time geometry of the particle emitting source. In this work,
a study of such correlations is perform using the hydrodynamical model
in 2+1 dimensions. Both the ideal and the viscous (shear and bulk)
fluid cases are considered. An equation of state inspired in lattice
QCD results, with a crossover phase transition between the quark-gluon
plasma and the hadronic phase, is employed. The results are compared
with experimental data on pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV.
