### Title: 

Hydrodynamical results on femtoscopy in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV

### Abstract: 

The hydrodynamical model has a long history in high-energy physics, being an essential tool for describing
the collective behaviour of the matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Recently,
experimental results have shown evidence of a similar collective behavior in small systems.
Femtoscopy or HBT Effect, are a powerful probe of the space-time geometry of the particle emitting source.
In this work, a study of such correlations is perform using the event-by-event hydrodynamical model in 2+1
dimensions (boost invariance) by vHLLE code \[1]. Both the ideal and the viscous (shear and bulk) fluid cases
are considered. The initial conditions was genereted by TRENTo model \[2]. An equation of state inspired in
lattice QCD results \[3], with a crossover phase transition between the quark-gluon plasma and the hadronic
phase, is employed. And the decoupling was calculated by THERMINATOR2 \[4]. The results are compared
with experimental data on pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV \[5].

### Title: 

Results on femtoscopy from hydrodinamics in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV

### Abstract: 

The hydrodynamical model has a long history in high-energy physics,
being an essential tool for describing the collective behaviour of
the matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and
LHC. Recently, experimental results have shown evidence of a similar
collective behavior in small systems (pp and pPb collisions).

Bose-Einstein correlation or femtoscopy, are a powerful probe of the
space-time geometry of the particle emitting source. In this work,
a study of such correlations is perform using the hydrodynamical model
in 2+1 dimensions. Both the ideal and the viscous (shear and bulk)
fluid cases are considered. An equation of state inspired in lattice
QCD results, with a crossover phase transition between the quark-gluon
plasma and the hadronic phase, is employed. The results are compared
with experimental data on pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV.
